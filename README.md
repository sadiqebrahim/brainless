# 🧠🚫 BRAINLESS  
**Zero brain cells required. Because honestly? We know you weren’t using them anyway.**

## The Problem  
Using your actual brain to debug? Kinda cringe. That gray matter is for doomscrolling and memorizing lore, not figuring out why `undefined` is not a function.

## The Solution  
**Brainless** is the main character energy your terminal has been begging for. It literally mogs your syntax errors while you sit there with zero thoughts behind those eyes. It fixes the bugs so you don’t have to talk to real people.

## Why you need this

- **It’s Giving Genius (Without the Effort)**  
  Stop trying to lock in. It’s embarrassing. Brainless reads your trash logs and hallucinates a fix that actually works. It eats the complexity so you don't have to.

- **Touch Grass Compatible**  
  Spend less time staring at a black screen wondering where you missed a semicolon, and more time doing... literally anything else.

## Installation (Don't overthink it)

You need Python 3. If you don't have that, I can't save you.
1. Clone the repo

Download this folder. Put it somewhere safe. Don't lose it.
2. Run the lazy installer

We wrote a script so you don't have to touch your config files manually. It detects if you're on Mac, Linux, or Windows and sets up the L alias for you.
Bash

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sadiqebrahim/brainless.git
cd brainless
python3 setup.py
```
3. Refresh your shell

The installer will tell you exactly what to type at the end (usually source ~/.zshrc or restarting PowerShell). Do what it says.
4. Set your API Key

If you are using the Cloud Mode (default), export your Gemini API key.

    Mac/Linux: export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"

    Windows: $env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"

(Pro tip: Add that line to your .zshrc or .bashrc so you don't have to type it every time. Or don't. See if I care.)

## 🚀 How to Run It

Don’t overthink it. Just admit defeat and type:

```bash
imdumb #or L
```
## ⚖️ Important
**Running Brainless, you legally agree that the AI is smarter than you.**
